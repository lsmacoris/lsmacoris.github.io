**About**
:::

I am an applied economist working as a Data Science Consultant at [Circana](https://www.circana.com/). I am also affiliated to [Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV - EAESP)](https://eaesp.fgv.br/en) as a Lecturer of Finance in the *Accounting, Finance, and Control Department*. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [INSPER](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/) (Institute of Education and Research, Sao Paulo) in May 2023.

In this site, you will find a repository of valuable resources, including lecture notes, technical handouts, and blog posts. These materials delve not only into my academic interests, but also into common themes that I encounter as a data practitioner and enthusiast, such as `R` and `Python` programming, Applied Economics, Econometrics, Statistics, and Data Analytics. For comprehensive access, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/lsmacoris) page, which hosts supplementary materials like coding notebooks and sample datasets.
