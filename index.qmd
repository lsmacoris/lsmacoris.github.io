**Welcome to my personal website :wink:**
:::

I am an Applied Economist currently serving as a Media Marketing Mix & Data Science Consultant at [Circana](https://www.circana.com/). I have received my Ph.D. in Economics from [INSPER](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/) (Institute of Education and Research, Sao Paulo) in May, 2023.

**Starting February 2024, I will be joining [Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV - EAESP)](https://eaesp.fgv.br/) as an Assistant Professor (part-time) of Finance in the *Accounting, Finance and Control Department*.**

On this site, you will find a repository of valuable resources including lecture notes, technical handouts, and blog posts. These materials delve into my academic and practitioner interests, spanning Corporate Finance, Causal Identification, R/Python Programming, and Consumer Behavior and Analytics. For comprehensive access, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/lsmacoris) page, which also hosts supplementary materials like coding notebooks and sample datasets.

By sharing some of my ideas along with a few lines of code, I aim to bridge the gap between what I am passionate about and what the broader community can learn from it. Hopefully, in the very long end, I can make someone passionate about these things, too :heart:

If you have any questions and/or comments, do not hesitate to reach out to through [this](mailto:lucasmacoris@gmail.com) email.
