## About me

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [INSPER](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/) (*Institute of Education and Research, Sao Paulo, Brazil*) in May 2023. I have also received my Bachelor's (in Management) and Master's Degree (Finance, Economics, and Econometrics) from the University of Sao Paulo (USP, Sao Paulo, Brazil). During my academic period, when I acquired an extensive hypothesis-driven research and problem-solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical/econometric analysis, and model development, my research was focused at the intersection between Corporate Finance and Financial Intermediation. More specifically, I studied how market frictions affect firms’ financing and investment decisions and the implications of these imperfections regarding managerial action, firms’ future outcomes, and market responses.

Throughout my academic journey, data in its diverse formats has been an integral part of my daily activities — a constant that will persist. I started writing my first few lines of code when I discovered [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) and enrolled in my first `R` programming course. Initially daunted by the complexity and the sheer shift from user-interface schemes, such as Excel, to programming languages, I found solace in the vibrant and supportive community spread in forum threads, *StackOverflow* pages, lecture notes, among other publicly shared materials - the companion for each and every aspiring programmer long before rise of generative AI. 

With a strong academic foundation in economics — particularly in corporate finance and econometrics — I’ve developed deep expertise in econometric modeling, time-series forecasting, and causal inference. My research and coursework have sharpened my ability to analyze complex datasets, uncover meaningful patterns, and apply rigorous empirical methods to real-world problems. Complementing this analytical background, my hands-on programming experience with tools like `Python`, `R`, and `SQL` enables me to build scalable data pipelines, implement statistical models, and deliver actionable insights. This blend of theoretical depth and technical proficiency positions me to bridge the gap between academic research and practical, data-driven solutions.

All in all, from what I can say, there's really nothing that could make me happier in my profession -- I hope this page explains why.
